  <h2>Our Expertise</h2>
  <p>At GradVoyage, we bring precision, insight, and empathy to every stage of your academic journey. Each application is more than a formality — it’s a story that reflects your aspirations, achievements, and individuality. Our expertise lies in transforming that story into powerful, polished documents that resonate with global admissions committees.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>SOP Writing</strong> – Your SOP is your personal narrative — a window into who you are, what drives you, and why you belong at your dream institution. We help you articulate your goals, experiences, and motivations in a clear, compelling, and authentic voice that captures attention and leaves a lasting impression.</li>
    <li><strong>LOR Drafting</strong> – A strong recommendation can elevate your application. We craft professionally written, credible, and balanced LORs that highlight your academic strengths, professional skills, and personal character — while maintaining authenticity and alignment with your overall profile.</li>
    <li><strong>Resume Crafting</strong> – Your resume is the first snapshot of your capabilities. We design and refine modern, internationally accepted formats that present your experience, achievements, and qualifications with clarity and impact — tailored specifically for graduate, MBA, and research applications worldwide.</li>
  </ul>
